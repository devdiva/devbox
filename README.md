# devbox
Provisioning for my development boxes.

The primary goal of this project is to bootstrapping my development boxes 
in a way that is consistent, repeatable and personalized. 

I liked Github's boxen when it was a thing -- like others, eventually my 
needs/desires diverged. There are most likely other projects of this ilk.
I may consider these in the future, in the meantime a personal approach feels
like the right direction.


## Goals

* Time-to-useable-system: 15min..1hr
* Automate new machine instance bootstrapping
* Flexiblity for configuring for personal, work or other flavors of use
* Scaffolding/population of working folders
* Personal framework for managing development box configuration
* Make me happy. :)

## Non-Goals

The following are complimentary goals which should be done in other tools or
resources (which may be used by this tool).

* dotfiles
* Security and hardening
